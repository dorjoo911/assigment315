    <h2>About me</h2>
    <pre>
           My name is Mike Erdene. I am a student of MIU. 
        Everyone can agree that I am a good student and that I like to study.
        My favorite subjects are JS and Web Development. 
        I am going to enter the metaverse because my goal is to 
        study these subjects in future and to become a respected 
        professional in one of the fields.
        I can say that I am a responsible and a hard-working student. 
        Moreover, being a sociable person, I have many friends since 
        I like to communicate with people and get to know new interesting 
        individuals. I enjoy my time at school: it is really nice to study, 
        the students are very friendly and ready to help. 
        The atmosphere cannot but make me want to go there every time. 
        I like to receive and deal with challenging tasks. I am a very 
        enthusiastic student and I think this is a strong point of mine.
        
        My friends say that I am a very funny and an interesting girl with 
        a good sense of humor. As soon as I meet new people who are 
        happy to meet me, I feel extremely comfortable with them. 
        I believe that friendship is one of the most important values 
        in human life. We exchange new ideas, find many interesting 
        things about each other and experience new things. I appreciate 
        friendship and people who surround me.</pre
